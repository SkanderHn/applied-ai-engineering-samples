The screws don't seem to fit.\\n\\n**Support Agent**: I understand. Let's try to figure this out together. Could you please check if there are any additional screws or parts included in the packaging that might be needed for the headboard attachment?\\n\\n**Customer**: Yes, I found a small pack of screws and some dowels. Are those the ones I need?\\n\\n**Support Agent**: Yes, those are the ones. The dowels are used to align the headboard with the bed frame, and then the screws are used to secure it in place. Let me guide you through the process.\\n\\n**Customer**: Okay, I'm ready.\\n\\n**Support Agent**: Perfect! First, insert the dowels into the holes on the headboard and the bed frame. Make sure they are aligned properly. Then, take the screws and start tightening them to secure the headboard to the bed frame.\\n\\n**Customer**: I'm doing that, but the screws are still not going in properly. They seem to be too short.\\n\\n**Support Agent**: I see. It seems like there might be a mix-up with the screws. Let me check something here. Please bear with me for a moment.\\n\\n**Customer**: Sure, take your time.\\n\\n**Support Agent**: After checking our records, it appears that there was indeed an error in the packaging of your bed set. The screws included were not the correct size for the headboard attachment. I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.\\n\\n**Customer**: Oh, that's frustrating. So what should I do now?\\n\\n**Support Agent**: Don't worry, we'll get this resolved for you. I'll immediately initiate a request for the correct screws to be dispatched to your address. They should reach you within the next 2-3 business days.\\n\\n**Customer**: Okay, that's a relief. But I still need the bed, you know. Can't you send someone to fix it?\\n\\n**Support Agent**: Unfortunately, we don't have any technicians available for immediate dispatch. However, I can offer you a partial refund for the inconvenience caused. Would that be acceptable to you?\\n\\n**Customer**: Well, I guess that's something. But I'm still not happy about this whole situation.\\n\\n**Support Agent**: I completely understand your frustration, and I want to assure you that we're doing everything we can to make this right. Once you receive the correct screws, assembling the bed should be a breeze. In the meantime, please accept our apologies for the trouble you've faced.\\n\\n**Customer**: Alright, I'll wait for the screws then. But I'm not going to shop from your store again.\\n\\n**Support Agent**: I'm sorry to hear that, but I hope you'll reconsider in the future. We value your satisfaction and will strive to improve our services to avoid such issues in the future.\\n\\n**Customer**: We'll see.
