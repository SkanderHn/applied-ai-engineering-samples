<h1 align="center">Vertex AI: Gemini Evaluations Playbook</h1>
<h3 align="center">Experiment, Evaluate & Analyze model performance for your use cases</h3>

## ✨ Overview

The **Gemini Evaluations Playbook** provides recipes to streamline the experimentation and evaluation of Generative AI models for your use cases using [Vertex Generative AI Evaluation service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview). This enables you to track and align model performance with your objectives, while providing insights to optimize the model under different conditions and configurations.

## 📏 Architecture

The following diagram depicts the architecture of the Gemini Evaluations Playbook. The architecture leverages 
 - Vertex Generative AI Evaluation service for running evaluations
 - Google BigQuery for logging prompts, experiments and eval runs.

<details><summary>✅ Log evaluation results with prompts and responses</summary>
Manage and log experiment configurations and results to BigQuery, enabling comprehensive analysis. <br>
</details>
<details><summary>✅ Customize evaluation runs</summary>
Customize evaluations by configuring prompt templates, generation parameters, safety settings, and evaluation metrics to match your specific use case.
</details>
<details><summary>✅ Comprehensive Metrics</summary>
Track a range of built-in and custom metrics to gain a holistic understanding of model performance. <br>
</details>
<details><summary>✅ Iterative refinement</summary>
Analyze insights from evaluation to iteratively refine prompts, model configurations, and fine-tuning to achieve optimal outcomes. <br>
</details>

## 🏁 Getting Started

### STEP 1. Clone the repository
   
```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/applied-ai-engineering-samples.git && cd applied-ai-engineering-samples/genai-on-vertex-ai/gemini_evals_playbook
```

### STEP 2. Prepare your environment

Start with [0_gemini_evals_playbook_setup](notebooks/0_gemini_evals_playbook_setup.ipynb) notebook  to install required libraries (using Poetry) and configure the necessary resources on Google Cloud. This includes setting up a BigQuery dataset and saving [configuration parameters](config.ini).

### STEP 3. Experiment, evaluate, and analyze

Run the [1_gemini_evals_playbook_evaluate](notebooks/1_gemini_evals_playbook_evaluate.ipynb) notebook to design experiments, assess model performance on your generative AI tasks, and analyze evaluation results including side-by-side comparison of results across different experiments and runs.

### STEP 4. Optimize with grid search

Run the [2_gemini_evals_playbook_grid_search](notebooks/2_gemini_evals_playbook_gridsearch.ipynb) notebook to systematically explore different experiment configurations  by testing various prompt templates or model settings (like temperature), or combinations of these using a grid-search style approach.
